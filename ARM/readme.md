### Overview

Throughout this hackathon, you will work through several scenarios and examples, to get a good understanding of how you can configure, deploy and manage your Azure resources at scale, with Azure Resource Manager.

We will start to cover the basics - just to get you started and level set on what we should accomplish. As you proceed through the different labs, things will indeed get a bit more complicated and hectic, but be assured that you will learn a lot and have fun!

We believe that by having an approach where we go through known, common scenarios to get the right context, it will simplify the learning, and make it more interesting. Therefor you will be presented with a high-level scenario in every lab, to better understand the "what" and "why", and we will guide you through the "how".

The instructor should also be capable of answering **any** question you might have **:-)**
